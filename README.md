# This repository contains the swift framework and Unity project with the swift plugin integrated to monitor the cpu usage, gpu usage and ram usage.
# This repository also contains the generated XCode project to run the test application.
# In the application, clicking on Start calls the swift code to monitor the metrics and when stop is clicked the monitoring is stopped.
# Once monitoring is done, the metrics are converted to json string and sent back to Unity and it is shown in the text view in the application and saved to a file as well.
